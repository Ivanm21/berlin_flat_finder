# Flat finder

Category: SaaS
Customer Type: apartment seekers in Berlin (students, young professionals, families, expats);
Description: An automated apartment hunting platform that sources rental listings from multiple channels (realtor sites, ImmobilienScout24, WG-gesucht, Facebook groups), generates personalized German-language applications with all required documents, submits applications automatically within minutes of posting, and tracks the entire application funnel with analytics on response rates and viewing success
Elevator Pitch: Finding an apartment in Berlin is nearly impossible. Traditional platforms like ImmobilienScout24 and WG-gesucht receive 100-300 applications per listing within the first hour, with response rates near zero for most applicants. Renters send 50-200+ inquiries and spend 1-6 months in their search, often with no success. We automate the entire rental application process. Our platform scrapes listings from realtor websites, ImmobilienScout24, WG-gesucht, Facebook groups, and other sources before they become saturated with applications. Using AI, we generate personalized cover letters in German, compile required documents (SCHUFA, income verification, Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung), and automatically submit applications within minutes of listings going live. We track every application through a CRM-style funnel, showing response rates, viewing invitations, and application status across all properties.
Niche: Berlin apartment seekers who are frustrated by the competitive rental market and need to maximize their chances by applying quickly and professionally to every relevant listing
Required Learning : Web scraping; German rental law;

Notes:
•	Berlin rental market stats: 23-day average listing period, 25% rented within 2 days
•	100-300 applications per listing in first hour
•	Average search time: 1-6 months, 50-200+ inquiries sent
•	Rent growth: 12% YoY to €15.79/sqm average
